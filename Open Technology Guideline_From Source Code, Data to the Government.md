The Open Culture Foundation (OCF) is an nonprofit organization which supports more than 40 technology communities since its establishment in 2014\. OCF has built a hub for developing open technology, by dedicating its efforts to promoting the notion of open technology, and further advocating for digital rights policies in Taiwan. OCF and the joint efforts of technology communities and civil society organizations, together we work on making Taiwan’s digital/internet environment more open, transparent, and involving. 

In recent years, OCF and technology communities have worked on cross-field cooperation. By working with technology communities to promote open technology and cross-sector cooperation through talent cultivation, community support, international connections, and public initiatives. The autumn speaker will be Taiwan’s science and technology community and other public/private sectors, and we will promote open technology and co-creation in the future. Protect digital human rights and support a transparent and inclusive digital civil society.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Technologies have drastically changed the world and the way of life for the past few decades. However, ever-evolving technologies have also brought forth social issues that no one has foreseen. Regarding this, Open Culture Foundation (OCF), based on its core principle of “open, transparent and participatory governance”, has started at the fundamental level with open source, open data and open government with the goal that the social context and multiple stakeholders will be considered during the process of technological development and the formulation of the usage scenarios of such technologies to reduce the social cost to address the impact by the emerging technologies. 

In 2003, Douglas Rushkoff, a media theorist, in his book “Open Source Democracy: How Online Communication is Changing Offline Politics”, mentioned that he believes that the new “digital renaissance” has already begun, during which people no longer simply accept the system’s arrangements for them in a passive manner. Instead, they are now able to make a difference, such as by voting online for a referendum ([Rushkoff, 2003 : 56-57](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp43882)). By 2009, digital technologies and open data have matured, making “open government” a mainstream concept. When former President Obama of the US first took office, he issued his first executive action – “Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government. At the time, former President Obama indicated that he would, through greater openness and new technologies, promote transparency and citizen participation in the government, which is meant to bridge the gap between the American people and their government and start a new era of an open and responsible government ([About Open Government | The White House, n.d.](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/open/about)). This executive action of former President Obama officially transformed the concept of open government with digital technologies into a political system.

“Open Technology \- From Source Code, Data to the Government: How “Open” Shapes the Digital Society of the New Era” describes open technologies’ definitions for “open source”, “open data”, “open government” and their associations and implementations in Taiwan. With this manual, OCF aims to help the government and advocates to better understand “open” and its context. The manual also includes OCF’s opinions and suggestions regarding the implementation of “open”.

# Chapter 1: Open Source – A Technological Solution with Public Participation {#chapter-1:-open-source-–-a-technological-solution-with-public-participation}

### Definition {#definition}

“Open Source” is defined by the Open Source Definition (OSD) by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The Open Source Definition [lists 10 criteria](https://opensource.org/osd/): free distribution, source code, derived works, integrity of the author’s source code, no discrimination against persons or groups, no discrimination against fields of endeavor, distribution of license, license must not be specific to a product, license must not restrict other software and license must be technology-neutral ([自由軟體鑄造場 & 葛冬梅,2012](https://ossf.denny.one/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=view&id=520&Itemid=56.html)).

The 10 criteria above reflect that the initial concept of “open source” comes from the vision for open software and licensed use while emphasizing its unique feature of free distribution to promote a positive cycle of open source. The current standard for open source code was determined by OSI, a non-profit organization founded by a group of software engineers headed by Bruce Perens and Eric S. Raymond in 1998\. OSI was founded with the sole purpose to determine and promote the definition of open source. The majority of the existing open source licenses, after being compiled by an individual or an organizational developer, will be submitted to OSI for review. If such license meets OSI’s Open Source Definition, it will be distributed as an open source license. An open source license allows software developers to choose how to share and collaborate with others while using, conducting research on, modifying and redistributing such source code. Such a license has created more opportunities for open source codes to be implemented.

In short, not only does open source software reflect the spirit of public participation, openness and transparency commonly associated with free software, it has also broken free from closed-source software’s restrictions. Thanks to its open source code in circulation, open source software has created high value in commercial applications and even established an open source code ecosystem that is both inter-disciplinary and more comprehensive. In this context, open source software has continued to be discussed and implemented in different disciplines and aspects across the globe. For commercial applications in particular, open source has been massively implemented.

### History {#history}

Free—closed—free—open source: Some technologies such as computers and coding have emerged from college campuses and other technologies have all emerged. At the time, college campuses were all about knowledge sharing, which gave birth to the environment that encourages open source. However, during the 70s and 80s, the open hacker and computer science cultures in academia declined and in turn, industries have merged. 

Commercial companies restricted the transparency and circulation of source code to maximize profits. As a result, circulation for both technologies and source codes have suffered. Richard Matthew Stallman, aka “father of open source”, was frustrated as he was not able to fix a closed-source driver for a printer and determined to rekindle the trend for the circulation of source codes. He started “GNU”, which was the first milestone for free/libre and open-source software (FOSS or FLOSS) for software engineers.

By the end of the 1990s, in contrast to free software, the concept of “open-source software” was born in a meeting held in Palo Alto, California. [In 1998](https://medium.com/@moz2000tw/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E6%AD%B2%E7%9A%84mozilla-70f9dbba6d27), Netscape, a company from Silicon Valley, initiated its “Mozilla” project, which released the suite source code of the Netscape browser, a drastic move in the face of fierce competition from Microsoft’s IE6, free for the public to use. This project marked the beginning of the open source movement ([see the Media Coverage](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A7%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD-%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84%E7%89%87-code-rush-%E6%8E%A2%E7%A9%B6%E7%AB%9F-161624629.html)).

With the release of the source code from Netscape’s project, people began to realize that the benefits of circulating source codes are not limited to the spread of knowledge. It can also help simplify the software development process and increase commercial applications and value, unlike free software which completely discards any commercial benefits. If the resources and investment from the industry can also be devoted to the ecosystem where source codes are circulated, contributed and reused, it will benefit the improvement and efficiency of overall technologies. Christine Peterson, a participant of the aforementioned meeting in Palo Alto, proposed the term “open source” to differentiate from “free software” at the time. Free software means that users have the freedom to run, study, distribute and change the software; open source software is part of the free software category and its license is less demanding than free software when it comes to “freedom to use” ([See Free Software Foundation, Inc](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.zh-tw.html)). 

The rise of the Internet, the popularization of personal computers in the 90s, steady growth in the global economy, strong performance by the emerging market and the fast growth in number of new Internet-based companies have propelled the popularity of open source worldwide and Taiwan was no exception.

It is nearly impossible to pinpoint the first proponent or the timeline of the first proposal of open source in Taiwan, as it was introduced from abroad. However, around year 2000, several open source communities have been formed in Taiwan, including TwLUG (Taiwan Linux User Group), TnLUG ( Tainan Linux User Group), TcLUG (Taichung Linux User Group) and KaLUG (Kaohsiung Linux User Group). With the rise in popularity of free software and open source, the meetings of such “communities'' have also expanded (H. Ger,2004[^1]).

There were four types of these communities:

1. **User Group**

   Like the aforementioned Linux User Group.

2. **E-learning Group**

   Groups that post tutorials on BBS, forums or any public platforms (such as the troubleshooting series of articles on the BBS Linux board on the Study-Area website).

3. **Localization Groups**

   Translation was a challenge to the promotion of open source in Taiwan. The sheer difficulty to establish a Mandarin environment prompted many users to discuss and collaborate to develop software extensions, such as CLE (Chinese GNU/Linux Extension). With this purpose in mind, many users have formed their own groups.

4. **Developer Groups**

   Among the developer groups in Taiwan, Elixus stood tall in the pack. Founded by Tsung-han Tang (currently known as Audrey Tang), Chia-liang Kao and others, Elixus promoted Perl (a programming language), blog and even wrote and translated technical books. There were also other groups consisting of mostly advanced coders or computer science students, such as FreeBSD and BSD User Group.

In June 2000, due to the absence of a communication channel between the open source communities in Taiwan and other countries, these communities in Taiwan wanted to establish a non-profit legal person organization to take on such tasks. After months of discussion and preparation, SLAT (Software Liberty Association Taiwan), an association with the goal to promote software liberty and serve the open source community, was formed on April 8, 2001\.

However, the global economy plummeted in the same year, with the dot-com bubble burst. As a result, many Internet-based companies shut down and the rise of open source in the private sector in Taiwan also slowed down. Meanwhile, the government of Taiwan gradually strengthened its support for open source.

In 2001, Taiwan was on the verge of joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, the [MP3 illegal download at Cheng Kung University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8MP3%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6) took place in April and the US government added Taiwan to its special 301 priority watch list. Therefore, the government proposes to amend relevant regulations to prevent insufficient intellectual property right protection from becoming a hurdle to Taiwan’s entry to WTO.

January 1, 2022, Taiwan officially became a member of WTO; in April of the same year, the Software Alliance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Information Service Industry Association jointly launched the “Business Against Piracy Campaign”. On May 1, the nation conducted a massive sweep against businesses using pirate software; at the same time, student activist groups launched an [anti “anti-piracy” movement](https://sex.ncu.edu.tw/intermargins/intermargins/YouthLibFront/YouthSubculture/AgainstIntellectualProperty/p406.htm)[^2], opposing the government working with businesses to investigate illegal and pirated software, which would increase the profit for these businesses while promoting monopoly in the software market and hindering diffusion of knowledge. As the result, society's attention is redirected to free software.

To encourage R\&D and innovation, promote free flow of information and reduce the cost for both the government and the enterprises, the government voiced its strong support for free software[^3]. In the same year, the National Information and Communication Initiative Committee (NICI) formed the “Free Software Steering Committee & Initiative Committee”; by the end of the year, Minister without Portfolio Ching-yen Tsai decided to use the Science and Technology Development Fund to subsidize Industrial Development Bureau’s “Free Software Industry Promotion Campaign”. Open Source Software Foundry (OSSF), established by Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica in 2003, was responsible for the “Free Software Management Platform Establishment Project”, a sub-project under the aforementioned campaign.

As part of the Free Software Industry Promotion Campaign, OSSF is responsible for its “Community Development and Communication” item, with the core mission to meet the needs of the free software development communities within Taiwan. In addition to developing free software development tools and its management platform (Open Foundry), OSSF also provides software developers with legal advice on licensing. OSSF also works with OSS Application Consulting Centre (OSSACC), which was founded by the industry and Software Liberty Association Taiwan, in many ways to promote the concept of free software to the industry, government, academia and the general public.

When OSSF was just founded, Internet bandwidth and hard drive space were still very expensive. However, Academia Sinica’s own server room and the bandwidth from its own dedicated Internet access helped provide the resources and assistance for the open source movement. OSSF also, before GitHub (a source code repository) became popular in Taiwan, established the very first and largest (at the time) open source software repository in Taiwan to facilitate the development of the open source community while establishing a free software talent pool and providing training courses. Until its closure in 2015, OSSF had been bridging the interactions between the industry, academia and the community, building the infrastructure for the open source community and maintaining the steady operation of the open source community at its initial stage in Taiwan.

In Taiwan, maybe it was due to the support from the government during its initial phase, the ”community” never disappeared despite the slowdown of the open source trend and the information technology and dot-com bubble during 1995 and 2001\. Many new open source communities were established after 2000, such as the Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters (COSCUP) in 2006 and g0v (gov-zero), which held the belief to make a difference with coding, in 2012\. These communities are still thriving and not only do they share open source codes, they are also devoted to building digital tools and solutions to overcome social issues.

As more private communities and non-official organizations formed, they continued to grow in size. As the result, they have to deal with massive and complicated cash flow from donations and sponsorships and the legal processes that came with them. In light of this, these community members reached consensus to establish a formal organization to assist the communities with basic operational work. In 2011, Po-feng Lee, a long-time open source community member, founded GOSCUP Inc. to address these needs. However, private enterprises or judicial associations still face restrictions when handling accounting and receipts from organizing seminars. In light of this, the community began discussing forming a legal person. 

In 2014, with the help from communities such as g0v, COSCUP, PyCon Taiwan and OSDC as well as individuals and businesses such as NETivism and Izero Lee, Open Culture Foundation was established, the very first legal person in Taiwan that aims to serve the open source community.

To this day, these communities built on the principle and spirit of open source, along with the digital tools that they built and initiative models, still play a pivotal role in the citizens’ oversight over the government as well as the participation in democracy.

### Current Development in Taiwan {#current-development-in-taiwan}

Contrast to the 90s, incorporating open source in system development and software service is nothing new nowadays. Take Microsoft for example. The software giant has put the source codes of the majority of its software products on the .NET platform and utilized the [Featured Project*s*](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects/)[^4] to showcase the company’s commitment to freedom and open source. The 2023 “[Open Source Security and Risk Analysis](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?intcmp=sig-blog-ossra22)” (OSSRA) report[^5] by Synopsys, the global leader in IC electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor intellectual property (SIP), reviewed many codebases and discovered that among these software built on source codes, 96% of them contained open source codes.

Thanks to the efforts by the government and private organizations described above, the development of open source in Taiwan has caught up with the global trend. As the public sector continues to learn about and implement open source, purchases commercial software in bulk, builds the anti-trust awareness for open source software, reduces relevant costs, introduces open document format (ODF, with odt, ods, odp, odb and odg as the default formats) and starts using open source on public service systems. For more than the past 20 years, the government has implemented an abundance of open source applications, such as the central government’s gradual development of the Open Data Platform starting in 2013, Taipei City Government’s release of the source code of i-Voting, an online voting platform and even releasing the source code of the “Taiwan Social Distancing” app that was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021\.

Between 2022 to 2023, the Ministry of Digital Affairs launched projects to translate open source software into Mandarin as well as the “Public Program Regulations Study & Promotion” project. With these projects, the Ministry of Digital Affairs worked with the industry, private communities and public/private legal persons to commit resources and time to promote open source awareness via interdisciplinary collaboration and in turn facilitate the society’s positive development and improve civic participation.

Open source has also been developing vibrantly in the private sector. Since 2000, the number of open source communities went from near zero to countless today. These communities initially focused on infrastructure and localization to reduce the language barrier and eventually shifted to open source hardware, open design, open source education, different program languages and many diverse fields. Civic communities such as g0v that connect social issues to technology groups have also been established.

As open source becomes more common and widely implemented in the global industrial chain, both its development and licensing and the awareness for both of them have drastically improved in Taiwan. However, the mindset of “hardware is everything” and closed source software monopoly have yet to change.

#### **Challenges of Open Source Implementation**

The relationship between open source development and its users is similar to the symbiotic relationship between an anemone and a clownfish, mutually depending on the other party’s contribution. In an ideal world, the open source community contributes source codes to facilitate software development. In turn, open source software will be available to the industry with no need of licensing fee. This applies to businesses using such software as well, who will give back to open source software and the community.

However, most businesses still cannot distinguish between open source software, free software and shareware because all three are available for free. They neglect the software license, which they should read and do not understand or care about the importance of open source regulations.

Even though Google, Microsoft and many business leaders have gone open source, many businesses in Taiwan still lack the understanding of open source guidelines and do not fulfil their obligations. As the result, source codes not no longer released to the open source communities, harming the main “redistribution” principle of open source. As this vicious cycle continues, open source software contributors will be discouraged and the sustainable development of the open source ecosystem is hindered.

#### **Key Management Element Neglected**

When open source codes are actually used in a software program, it can be a combination of lines from different source codes. A product itself may contain several software programs, making it challenging to verify what source codes were used and if each software program’s license has been complied with. Open source is like assembling a car where it is much faster to use pre-made parts from various brands to put together a comprehensive and even innovative product. However, if a product, during its various stages of development, utilizes source codes from different software programs, then it will be a major challenge to properly manage the sources and license of the open source codes from these software programs throughout the entire software production supply chain.

Lack of management of the open source code in the supply chain is like a car builder not in full control of the parts installed on a car. When a company does not fully know what open source software or the references of its source code, it will have trouble detecting any flaws; vulnerabilities will emerge if all the software programs used in the product are not kept up-to-date. These flaws, if accumulated, will make product maintenance and software troubleshooting much more difficult or lead to data security breaches. Therefore, proper management of all free and open source software, compile the list of all software utilized, confirm that all licenses are complied with and ensure proper management and provide internal training on procurement, development, operation and promotion are all necessary tasks for organizations, businesses and even governments when using open source.	

#### **Non-compliance of License May Lead to Lawsuits for Breaching**

Massive utilization of open source software is common for many businesses nowadays. However, the industry is generally unfamiliar with the licensing terms and companies usually do not have staff dedicated to studying licensing terms. As the result, companies that use lots of open source code may breach the licensing terms without knowing it. Even though there are no lawsuits for breaching licensing terms in Taiwan, Taiwanese companies have faced such lawsuits overseas. Therefore, it is crucial for companies and organizations to comply with licensing terms and incorporate open source software in their software projects without copyright infringement.

### Future Direction {#future-direction}

OCF believes that open source can further propel the development of both products and the industry. Open source is also the foundation for the digital era as well as freedom on the net and digital human rights. Only with more diverse production of source codes and technologies without monopoly can everyone be involved to build a digital society that is fair, free and protects users’ rights. Therefore, open source should not be limited to open source software and hardware, it should also apply to the mindsets, actions and values towards technological advancement.

OCF has three major objectives for open source:

1. **A Healthy Open Source Software Ecosystem**  
     
   To promote open source in Taiwan, it takes more than just inviting more users. We also need to establish the cycle where contributors contribute and users give back, facilitating the opening, collaboration, improvement and re-sharing of more software.   
     
   To achieve this objective, it will require non-profit organizations to continue to promote the open source concept, helping various users, including governments, commercial usage, communities and individuals, truly go open source.  
   Since open source knows no borders, OCF’s goal, other than promoting open source in Taiwan, is to continue to introduce the global trends in open source as well as related regulations, education and ethics. Regional and international collaboration is required to build a healthy open source ecosystem. As one of the open source promoters in Taiwan, OCF is committed to connecting users both domestic and abroad and facilitating cooperation by matching resources.  
     
   We firmly believe that when the open source ecosystem is complete, there will no longer be a monopoly over people’s rights to digital technologies, which can propel the positive development of digital technologies.  
     
2. **Urge the Government’s Implementation of PMPC to Achieve Open Technologies**  
     
   For many of the government’s commissioned information system services, be it that the government has obtained the copyright to the software or co-own the copyright with the tender winner,  once the project ends, there will be disruptions to the development, modification and maintenance of the software in the project. Tender winners for each project may not work together and with multiple parties co-owning the copyright to the software, a small functional change will require the government to go through the procurement process again.  
     
   Software developed using the taxpayers’ money should be considered “public goods” that belong to the public. OCF believes in “Public Money, Public Code (PMPC)” in response to the disruption to the software maintenance in government’s commissioned information service projects. In addition, PMPC can break through the restrictions of multiple copyrights and reduce excessive government spending due to repetitive procurement in light of software updates. With open source, it indirectly prevents monopoly by a single supplier in public services.  
     
   There are many examples of government agencies adopting open source software worldwide: LiMux, an operating system developed by the City of Munich, Germany, utilizes Ubuntu, an open source OS on Linux. Limux manages to run on thousands of computers, saving millions of German taxpayers’ money[^6]. The British government utilizes many open source software in its digital services, such as WordPress, MongoDB[^7] and Node.js. The Whitehouse uses open source tools on Drupal on its official website and releases the source code to the public.

   Overall, OCF urges the government to formulate regulations over the procurement, development and use of digital systems while adopting open source software solutions to make it public, instead of a special case. When a supplier wins a government tender, it no longer holds on to the copyright of the software. Take the government’s project to adopt “ODF-CNS15251” as the standard document format in 2015 for example. This project allowed the government system to gradually move away from Office, a closed-source software. Now the government institutions are commonly using ODF (open document format), which facilitates exchanges globally, is easier to store for a long period of time and can prevent disruptions due to software updates.

   

3. **Encourages All Parties to Obtain Open Chain Certification to Reduce Legal Risks**  
     
   Very often the industry, due to misconception about information security, business considerations or lack of understanding about the scope of the software license, fails to credit the original author as required by the license, does not take inventory of all open source software used, chooses to conceal the free or open-source software utilized, stops releasing source codes or uses open source resources without contributing source codes to open source projects. Such behavior will destroy the balance in the  sustainable open source ecosystem and drastically reduce the development potential of open source.  
     
   “OpenChain[^8]”, a project proposed by Linux Foundation Project, is a project aiming to make open source trusted in a supply chain with consistent process management information and make this an industry standard. Currently, OpenChain maintains to ISO/IEC standards for the industry: OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 (the international standard for open source license compliance programs) and OpenChain ISO/IEC 18974 (the industry standard for open source security assurance programs) [^9]. Businesses can, via online testing, commissioning an independent agency or an impartial third party to verify their open source management as OpenChain standard-compliant.  
   

### FAQ {#faq}

#### **PMPC Details**

“Public Money, Public Code (PMPC)” was proposed by Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). It means that if a program is developed on the public dime, its source code should be made public. PMPC urges the government to first choose open source software solutions when establishing, procuring or leasing a digital system. The government should also make public the system’s source code so the public can help improve the system’s operation and even help detect information security vulnerabilities. Not only will this improve the system’s safety and dependability, it can also reduce government spending and enhance mutual trust between the government and the public. Currently, countries including Germany and Denmark have mandated the release of source code in the government’s digital transformation, a proof of this practice’s feasibility and future development potential.

Specifically, the government enjoys the following while adopting open source software:

**Lower Cost:** A high licensing fee comes with developing or procuring software. When using open source software, however, there is no or a lower licensing fee, which cuts the cost significantly.

**Improved Information Security:** With anyone capable of checking to discover any vulnerabilities, this makes open source software safer. Compared to closed-source software, open source software can greatly reduce security risk.

**Prevent Supplier Monopoly:** Large-sized suppliers usually have an advantage in the bidding of government tenders. With an open source software solution, it is possible to choose different suppliers and thus reduce the risks from monopoly.

**Improve Transparency:** When a government uses open source software, it is usually required to make public related source codes and documents, which enhances the government’s transparency and the people’s trust in the government.

**Promote Software Sustainability:** With open source software, when there is maintenance required or a new feature being added, the succeeding supplier does not need to re-develop the software and can conduct update and maintenance using the existing open source codes. This greatly reduces the inconvenience resulting from the information asymmetry and competition among different suppliers in a government procurement project.

#### **Open Source’s Impacts Outside of Software?**

**Creative Commons License**

Open source also deeply influences how to expand knowledge and intellectual property while protecting related rights. Creative Commons License (CC) 1.0 was launched on December 16, 2022 and eventually launched [4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/list.zh-hant) in 2013\. According to [CC Taiwan](https://tw.creativecommons.net/home-page/), Creative Commons license has a “some rights reserved” approach where the creator can set up the licensing terms and make his/her work available to the public regardless of the person, time and place. Such licensing will inspire people to willingly share their creative works, facilitating the free flow and accumulation of cultural resources. As the results, more creative works will be inspired, which maximizes the value of creative works.

**Open Source Hardware**

Open source also inspired the concept of “open hardware”, which has the appeal to allow free software developers to study the entirety of how source codes operate. The way modern hardware operates is very complicated, including CPU, graphics card, wireless signal receiver and programmable logic device (PLD). These hardware must be controlled by software. Only by combining software and hardware can these devices perform to their fullest([Open Foundry& D. Ger, 2009](https://ossf.denny.one/tw/legal-column-list/2183-2010-07-15-10-16-01.html)).

 “Open Source Hardware” was defined by Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). OSHWA listed 12 definitions for open source hardware based on the concept of open source software, including necessary software, derived works, no discrimination against persons or groups and license must not be specific to a product([VMAKER, 2023](https://vmaker.tw/archives/66534)).

The most known example is Raspberry Pi (Linux desktop) and Arduino (electric sampling system). Take Raspberry Pi for example. The design of all its hardware is open source, fulfilling its initial vision to “reduce cost to improve basic computer science education at school” and achieve diverse utilization. However, open source hardware also faces challenges similar to open source, which is unclear licensing and wrongful use due to ambiguous licensing terms.

# Chapter 2: Open Data – The Cornerstone for Digital Transformation {#chapter-2:-open-data-–-the-cornerstone-for-digital-transformation}

### Definition {#definition-1}

Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone \- subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike. [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/zh-tw/) points out that open data must meet these requirements in its distribution: open license, access, machine readability and open format; compared to the strict definitions mentioned above, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, suggested “[5 stars deployment scheme for Open Data](https://5stardata.info/zh-TW/)“ to evaluate data openness.

Modern country governance is based on the census on its citizens and territory. Therefore, a country will collect lots of data and information on its citizens. Today, as the digital mindset is incorporated into the government’s policy implementation and services, the government collects and compiles even more digital data.

Compared to traditional copyright’s restrictions over reuse, reproduction and distribution of knowledge and data, “open data” emphasizes on knowledge being public and flowing freely. On the foundation of digital administrative processes, only by deploying and introducing open data can we build a strong and shared field, which allows us to “use” the data and civilians to collaborate with the government to build a new governance model. Contrast to the government’s emphasis on the value-added application or technological application of open data, the concept of open data was developed with the sole purpose to promote public participation.

Government data should be open data, as it should not be possessed solely by the government or specific politicians. Government data is about every aspect of people’s lives and its collection relies on the public dime. Government institutions are only fulfilling their obligations to collect, preserve and manage various information on behalf of the people ((陳舜伶、 林珈宏、莊庭瑞, 2013[^10]). The people should be granted the rights to these data owned by the public, allowing them to freely access and use such data. This manual also addresses the issue regarding how to open such data while protecting privacy.

### History {#history-1}

The promulgation of the Freedom of Government Information Law marked the beginning of the development of open data in Taiwan nearly 20 years ago. At the time, [Global Right to Information Rating (RTI Rating)](https://www.rti-rating.org/country-detail/?country=Taiwan) [^11] ranked Taiwan 124th among 135 countries for insufficient legal framework and lack of regulations to actively promote open data. In RTI Rating’s evaluation of Taiwan, ambiguous open data procedures, weak punishment for damaging data accessibility and only providing open data to foreigners whose home countries provide open data to Taiwanese citizens are the 3 major obstacles to open data development in Taiwan ([Centre for Law and Democracy](https://www.law-democracy.org/live/), 2005).

In 2012, the government of Taiwan officially implemented open data-related policies and promulgated “Open Data Operational Guidelines for Executive Yuan and its Ministries and Agencies” in 2013\. Executive Yuan even named 2015 as the first year to actively promote open data usage. Executive Yuan started in 2018, through Presidential Hackathon or other incentives, to encourage the public to participate in and the government to deepen its open data creation and application. As the result, Taiwan was ranked 1st by Global Open Data Index (GODI) [^12] three years in a row from 2015 to 2017\.

With the promotion by the private sector and the government’s governance mindset becoming increasingly open, with the National Development Council’s assistance, six special municipalities signed the Open Data Charter (ODC) in 2018, making them the first group of cities to sign ODC in Asia[^13]. In 2019, the government launched “Smart Government Action Plan”, another progressive step for open data, which allows various central government agencies to launch their own action plans.

In 2022, Ministry of Digital Affairs was formed, responsible for “open data” and related data governance measures. In addition to operating the government’s Open Data Platform and conducting related assessments, the ministry is also responsible for integrating the data governance between government agencies and the private sector.

From the government’s current policies, it can be concluded that the Ministry of Digital Affairs aims to use open data to assist the government with its governance and stimulate the economic development in the private sectors. The ministry’s policies include: establish an open consultation mechanism for the government, build a trusted open data environment, promote public-private interdisciplinary partnership and enhance collaboration with the private sector to improve data quality. Concrete measures include the launch of data quality symbols and incentives to encourage government agencies to provide quality and easy-to-use data that meets the people’s needs.  The ministry also, via executive orders, promulgated the “Government Data Standards”, which provides various API standards and the guidelines over conferences held by the open consultation groups at various central government agencies.

### Current Development in Taiwan {#current-development-in-taiwan-1}

In reality, it is difficult to ensure that each central government agency maintains the same quality and follows the same guidelines over open data with simply executive orders, regulations and guidelines. The National Development Council, in early 2020, attempted to draft “Open Data and Data Reuse Law” to build a comprehensive legal framework for open data. However, the draft has been shelved since the reorganization of the National Development Council. Currently, there is not a set of regulations on open data that applies to all levels of government agencies. Despite the fact that in the first half of 2023, Ministry of Digital Affairs started amending and integrating various executive order-type documents, the ministry did not seem to work towards building a legal framework. Instead, it was simply responding to the changing government structure and meeting the needs of its various operations.

Currently, the concept of “open data” for government agencies in Taiwan is similar to the 3-star open data (of the 5-star standard), which includes “open license” (star 1), “available as structured data” (star 2\) and “available in non-proprietary open data” (star 3, e.g., CSV instead of XLS and XLSX). The majority of these data is available on the government’s Open Data Platform. It is basically machine-readable with original files available. However, these data still fall short of becoming 4-star (data reuse) or even 5-star (link your data to other data for other applications). The 5 major traits and challenges face the development of government open data in Taiwan:

1. **Difficult Execution Due to Lack of Regulations**

Since the promulgation of the Freedom of Government Information Law, it has been the closest thing we have as a legal basis for government open data. Even with “Open Data Operational Guidelines for Executive Yuan and its Ministries and Agencies”, a set of admirative guidelines promulgated in 2013, various levels of government agencies still struggle with the lack of legal basis and unclear definitions when implementing open data. As the result, open data faces different obstacles at different agencies and its implementation may rely on the willingness of the heads of the agencies. With the Ministry of Digital Affairs responsible for formulating open data policies, it does provide a set of executive orders and guidelines, including various regulations, meeting guidelines and verification tools. However, their implementation still is at each government agency’s discretion.

The government’s open data execution in the past 10 years also reflects the lack of upper-level legislation. With no single government agency with full authority and regulatory tools over open data, IT staff of all government agencies are responsible for helping the business units release data for dataset collection. Since information departments are only auxiliary units and do not manage data and most business units do not have an information background and therefore are not familiar with the concept and implementation technologies of open data. The government also does not offer systematic courses on open data. Therefore, open data still cannot be incorporated into the government’s decision-making process. With “open data” still not viewed as a necessary and professional tool, open data is only a heavy burden to executors, which makes it difficult to manage dataset quality and encourage government agencies to open their data. 

2. **Promotion Does Not Generate Lasting Impacts**

The central government has been holding the Presidential Hackathon since 2018\. This event is considered by the private sector as the icon of public-private partnership and open data promotion. However, most projects to promote open data simply do not have lasting momentum. For an event with such strong identity like the Hackathon, government agencies are more likely to collaborate to pursue their self-interests instead of engaging in meaningful cross-department collaboration. In addition, award-winning projects from old proposals revised by different teams[^14], although getting more refined and improving actual implementation of public-private partnership, also indicate that proposals cannot be sustained in a meaningful way, possibly due to lack of funding or being impractical, which prevent them from cross-department implementation and actually benefiting the civil society. As the result, it makes it look like open data is only for the few and capable.

3. **Quality Too Inconsistent to Meet the Public’s Needs**

According to the “Open Data User Survey” [^15] by Tung-Mou Yang, professor at the Department of Library and Information Science, National Taiwan University, in 2022, government data users generally have low satisfaction with the quality and regulations of government open data, with below-average scores for data completeness and format. However, with the majority of data sources in the control of the government, if the government continues to open data, the survey participants are still very willing to use government open data.

According to “To Use or Not to Use? Exploring the Factors Influencing Professional Reusers’ Intention to Adopt and Utilize Governmental Open Data in Taiwan” [^16], another paper by Prof. Tung-mou Yang, users find that the government lags behind when it comes to updating travel-related data and therefore cannot meet their needs. Not to mention that users can collect such information on their own, making them barely dependent on government open data. But with the government in control of the majority of legal data or real-time data that requires a massive cost for collection and update, such as real-time traffic updates, the public heavily relies on the government for such data. As the result, there is a great disparity among industries when it comes to the dependence on government open data. In reality, with the exception of the few datasets that are complete and scare that have been truly utilized, other datasets remain to be improved and constructed by the government.

4. **Dataset Quality Evaluation Standards Remains to Be Adjusted to Be Realistically Utilized**

Starting in 2017, the “Open Data Platform” (currently under the Ministry of Digital Affairs), began auditing its datasets[^17] and began awarding prizes to government agencies to encourage them to promote open data autonomously. From [Open Government Quality Symbols & Incentives](https://file.data.gov.tw/content/%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%84%AA%E8%B3%AA%E6%A8%99%E7%AB%A0%E6%9A%A8%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E6%87%89%E7%94%A8%E7%8D%8E%E5%8B%B5%E6%8E%AA%E6%96%BD%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A.pdf), the criteria for the Golden Quality Award is mainly “machine-readable” and open formats, with less assessment over the data’s reuse value; the criteria for People’s Choice Award is mainly on data interaction and utilization. However, open data is all about utilization and interaction, which can best promote open data to better data economics. Therefore, the government needs to further contemplate its incentives towards open data. In recent years, various central government agencies and local governments list their open data awards as their achievements, an indication that the incentives do influence high-level government officials’ decision-making. Thus, it is worth discussing how to revise the award standards to further promote open data. 

5. **Open Data’s Privacy Invasion**

With technologies advancing daily, mature data analysis techniques and sufficient open datasets may be used to identify the personal information and identities of the people involved. In the definitions of many open data, they emphasize that the data collected must be “non-personal” information, in other words, data that does not include information of specific people ([What is open data?](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/zh_TW/what-is-open-data/)). Open data is not supposed to involve anyone’s privacy because it is predicated on its data not including any personal information. However, it is getting more and more likely to cross-reference and connect different datasets to reidentify personal data from the datasets. Regarding this, it cannot be denied that open data has privacy invasion risk when used in unintended purposes.

Open data was designed to improve the public’s well-being. Therefore, to give up open data or restrict its utilization for an ounce of privacy invasion risk, according to [Geothink(2016)](https://citizens-guide-open-data.github.io/guide/4-od-and-privacy) and other scholars, simply does not make sense. However, if open data involves any social/public issues (such as the COVID-19 patient records across the nation during the pandemic) and the government, after much contemplation, decides to partially or not even release such data, “for the general public, it is stripping them of their right to know, making more question the government’s credibility” ([iThome,2020](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/137905)). Therefore, a system should be developed to formulate the regulations and oversee the value-added applications of open data. This system will determine whether to not release, partially release or release data after processing it with privacy enhancing technologies to lower privacy invasion risks.

### Vision: OCF Expects Open Data to Protect People’s Rights and Improve Their Welfare {#vision:-ocf-expects-open-data-to-protect-people’s-rights-and-improve-their-welfare}

Open and use data at will has its risks. What’s more, with the public and the government incapable of distinguishing between public data, public information and open data, identifying the original data from de-identified data and information and thus invading privacy becomes more likely. 

For OCF, “open data” does not mean that all data should be open but that there should be clear regulations and a comprehensive system deciding what data should be made open safety and reused. In particular, data related to the public and owned by the government (not personal information) should be made public with open license in a machine-readable format, allowing the industry, government and academia to fully utilize such data in the digital era to promote social development.

In the next 10 years, OCF expects the Taiwanese government to, prior to promoting various data governance measures and policies, enhance the construction, use and promotion of open data while promoting the promulgation of a comprehensive set of regulations and a third-party oversight framework. Only comprehensive regulations can ensure data use can protect privacy while promoting social development. However, building a suitable legal framework that can adapt to social changes is no simple task. In the initial stage, all stakeholders must engage in collaboration and discussion to build a review and revision mechanism, such as an oversight platform and litigation relief channels for the civil society.

By opening data, the government can promote democracy, governance transparency, public participation, administrative efficiency and governance quality. It can even promote innovation and create more values to broaden the welfare of the public. With the Taiwanese government becoming increasingly digitalized, the key issue is how to re-release government data and allow the people to utilize it.

OCF, with the spirit of openness and collaboration, promotes open data. We are well aware that, in this digital era, we cannot rely on one single field when dealing with various complicated issues. Therefore, on open data and other broader data governance issues, OCF will continue to work closely with civic groups and scholars in legal, human rights, public administration and other areas.

### Future Direction {#future-direction-1}

With the digital environment developing rapidly, the incorporation of digital technologies and the Internet in our daily lives and the government has made it more possible for “individuals” to participate in the decision-making process of public policies, with “open data” as the tool to achieve this goal. Only by constructing open data can the public participate and oversee the government and thus improve the government’s governance transparency. Open data aims to improve the people’s welfare, not value-added and financial applications. OCF will continue to promote open data with the following directions:

1. **Establish a Legal Framework for Government Open Data**  
     
   Currently, the most urgent and indispensable step is to build a legal framework for open data. A legal framework for open data will have data set to “open” as default, which will change the behavior and culture of the public sector and formulate consistent standards across central and local government agencies in policy-making and budget-planning. If a legal system means that government data will be open as default, not only can government data be steadily available to the public and government agencies for reuse, open data license[^18] can protect government workers from being influenced by political pressure or from being held accountable wrongfully due to the supervisor or external influence.

   

   Whether or not to revise current regulations or promulgate a dedicated law for government open data requires further discussion. However, there is consensus among the scholars: First, the legal framework must cover both central and local governments. If the first set of open data regulations are low-hierarchy laws, there must be a mechanism in place to iterate open data laws and promote them to higher hierarchy. The goal is to make “government open data” as the underlying guidelines for all government agencies. According to “ [**Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024)[^19]” , government agencies’ data should be open in principle and closed as exception. Data from the private sector can only be requested to be open only for the public good, which must be verified. With the public and private sectors have contrasting principles and exceptions, the key lies in how the line is drawn between the public and private sectors. Finally, there must be clear allocations of responsibilities. Competent authorities for government open data must be specified for all levels of government agencies with clear powers and the supervisors must have a related technology background.

   

**2\.		How to Create More Value out of Open Data Available to the Public**

With the government as the main data owner entrusted by taxpayers, it should carefully evaluate whether or not to open data and must do so under the guidance of clear regulations. Open data should be mostly provided for free. Even though this means no direct profit for the government, open data does facilitate value-added applications.

Currently, “value-added” usually is limited to commercial profit. However, with open data as a public good, innovative application and analysis of data can help improve people’s quality of life, help businesses innovate their services and thus boost the economy indirectly.

The industry will have the need to apply open data for other purposes. However, when releasing the data, the government should avoid considering data cleansing and server connection costs as the obstacles to open data. The government can approach cost reduction in these two aspects: First, consider data openness during the data collection process to reduce data cleansing and processing costs that ensue; secondly, consider splitting data into different streams. If the government works with a third party, such as an academic organization or National Center for High-performance Computing, to concatenate data, it can formulate a business model based on the number, frequency and immediacy of connection and other factors. This will allow business operators to have quick access to real-time data while ensuring that data transparency and openness will not be restricted by the cost; For example, most people only access a small amount of open data from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. However, if a business wants to develop a related application or service, it will need to access such data at an extremely high frequency, which is a heavy burden to the server. Therefore, businesses with such needs should pay for such data access. 

By opening government data, we can create a society that is more transparent and open with better civic participation, increase trust in the society and promote friendly dialogue, which is the value that open data brings to the public.

### FAQ {#faq-1}

#### **Difference Between Big Data and Open Data**

“Big data” refers to the complicated datasets that traditional data processing software cannot manage. A single dataset in “open data”, once it has reached a certain volume, can also be labelled as “big data.” In recent years, with the popularity of technologies such as text mining, using such technologies to analyze a massive volume of non-structured or structured data from all sources is referred to as “big data analysis.”

#### **Difference Between “Public Information” and “Open Data”**

First, let us clarify the definitions of “information”, “data”, “public” and “open”, which will help us distinguish between “public information” and “open data.”

* **Definitions of “Information” and “Data”:**  
    
  * Data: The unprocessed and uninterpreted raw records that can be used to form information and knowledge.  
  * Information: Data that has been processed into readable and understandable content and information.  
      
* **Definitions of “Public” and “Open”:**  
    
  * Public: Information that is made public online  or via physical channels without clear framework over the file formats and machine accessibility of such information.  
      
  * Open: Data that can be freely used, reused and distributed by anyone. It emphasizes machine-readability and accessibility as well as equal rights to reuse and access such data.  
      
* **The difference between “public information” and “open data” can be concluded by the definitions above:**  
    
  * Public information: Publish processed data to the public, emphasizing on the users’ right to know.  
      
  * Open data: Follows the 5-star model, emphasizing on the users’ right to use. Open data with more stars may not be easily read by human users but can be easily read and used by machines.  
      
    For example, If the government publishes an information chart regarding polluted basins in a PDF file, which is easy to read for users but difficult for a machine to read and use the information. The website hosting such files will require maintenance and updates. However, with a file in an open format with raw records and source codes available and linked to related datasets, general users may not be able to understand it but a machine can easily extract data from the file.

#### **Different Names for Open Data Among Different Government Agencies?**

In the context of government governance in Taiwan, open data is mostly referred to as “Open Government Data”. However, it has different names for different businesses across different departments. For example, the Administration for Digital Industries under the Ministry of Digital Affairs, to encourage private industries to provide data and to create more values by overlaying such data with open government data, refers to open government data both domestic and abroad as “[open data](https://www.datastation.org.tw/opendata)”. The majority of such data comes from the released datasets from 10 industries, including e-commerce, finance/insurance, biotech/medicine, information service, electronic manufacturing, communications/Internet, education/job-seeking, tourism, outdoor sports and marketing. The Department of Democracy Network proposed “[data democratization](https://moda.gov.tw/digital-affairs/democracy-network/360)”, which aimed to promote public participation using open data. Department of Plural Innovation’s “[Data Altruism](https://moda.gov.tw/digital-affairs/plural-innovation/operations/270)” project refers to de-identified non-personal data that is collected jointly by the private and public sectors as “data.”

#### **Can Open Data Reveal Personal & Private Information?**

Despite their difference in opinions, scholars both domestic and abroad have the 4 suggestions below to reduce personal data breaches:

1. Data minimalism: Only collect relevant and necessary data.  
2. A committee comprising multiple stakeholders to oversee data collection and utilization.  
3. The exercise of the right to be forgotten: The public has the right to decide whether or not to share their related data to be reused by the government in open government data or open datasets.  
4. Full implementation of privacy laws: People are confused about public information and open data. However, de-identified public information often contains a lot of personal data. If it is to be made open by mistake, it will severely invade personal privacy.

#### **What About Privacy Concerns?**

Even though it is rare that someone can put together personal information using open data. The international community also pointed out that it is difficult to regulate and even punish such behavior with existing regulations. Currently, Taiwan only has its Personal Data Protection Act and does not have a more specific privacy oversight framework to monitor and punish the behavior above. Without a legal framework established for open government data, it is necessary to have an interdisciplinary third-party stakeholder to counsel and oversee the construction and use of open data as the safeguard for people’s privacy and rights.

# Chapter 3: Open Government – Build a Government with Transparency, Efficiency, Public-Private Partnership and Accountability {#chapter-3:-open-government-–-build-a-government-with-transparency,-efficiency,-public-private-partnership-and-accountability}

### Definition {#definition-2}

As a governance principle, “open government” claims that citizens have the right to know and access the government’s documents, files, data and the progress of any projects to achieve effective public oversight. In the broadest sense, “open government” opposes a government in possession of any unnecessary secrets as well as the legalization of “excessively protection of confidential information and data” by the government to prevent the government from easily categorizing any information as confidential information and thus withholding it from the public.

“Open government”, as an initiative and movement, urges the government to, as early as possible, include civic participation in its decision-making process and allow the citizens to be involved in necessary government data, which will facilitate frequent exchanges between the government and citizens on an equal footing, making the government’s decision-making process transparent and effective.

### History {#history-2}

“Open government” can be traced back to the European Enlightenment period when the philosophers discussed how to properly build an emerging and democratic society. Many democratic reforms and movements since the period echoed this concept. The same governance principle was also developing in the 60s in the US, which led to the promulgation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1967, which specified that administrative agencies must comply with citizens’ requests to access records from any federal agency. The act stipulated that in addition to actively publishing and providing the public with documents, files and governance progress that they have requested under its jurisdiction, a federal agency cannot deny the citizens’ request to access any record and must ensure an open and smooth communication channel. The act also, as expected, listed 9 exceptions, including any sensitive or private data.

In 2005, Taiwan government promulgated the Freedom of Government Information Law to allow the citizens to share and fairly access government information, protect the public’s right to know, increase the public’s understanding, trust and oversight of public affairs and promote civic participation. This law protects the right of the citizens, legal persons and some foreigners to apply to access government information. Since the promulgation of this law, it has become the legal basis for open government data.

Outside of the legal framework in Taiwan, in 2011, under the US’s guidance, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, England and the US established the [Open Government Partnership (OGP)](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/) and signed the Open Government Declaration to promote the open government concept across the globe. In light of varying levels of democratic development and political contexts among nations, OGP redefined “open government” with 4 core elements: transparency, participation, accountability and inclusion. With this, open government was no longer just a slogan or governance principle. Instead, it was promoted to a reform initiative. By redefining the relationship between the government and civil society, connecting government agencies, non-profits, the international community and the citizens as multiple stakeholders, the top-down hierarchy is broken with horizontal links created to promote open governance.

With the establishment of OGP, its Secretariat and increasing number of member nations, “open government” became a systematic implementation project where nations can follow the guidance and evaluation indicators to establish and promote their own open government action plan that meets the international standard.

The Taiwan government, since 2020, followed the OGP principles and autonomously formulated two national action plans: One is the [Open Government National Action Plan](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=8F565FF6680947F5) under the Executive Yuan and other is the [Open Parliament Action Plan](https://www.ly.gov.tw/Pages/Detail.aspx?nodeid=44847&pid=207514) under the Legislative Yuan. Both action plans have been implemented since their formulation till 2023 and now there is expectation that there will be a second version for both of these action plans.

### Current Development in Taiwan {#current-development-in-taiwan-2}

In the digital era, public government information, open data and open government initiative are closely related and even highly overlapped. 

Currently, open data and government in Taiwan are mostly regulated by agency guidelines and executive orders, not laws that have been passed by the legislative process. As the result, there are restrictions with the current open data guidelines as they can only regulate agencies under the Executive Yuan with no specified guidelines for the open data format. Therefore, some members of the open data community believe that there should be a special law for open data. The Ministry of Justice attempted to incorporate the concept of open data into the Freedom of Government Information Law via amendments. Such attempt failed as there was no consensus regarding open data.

Due to the lack of legal infrastructure and being on the low hierarchy in the current law, open data and digital governance still cannot thrive after all these years. Without a paradigm to follow, civic participation in open data and digitalization all rely on the rule of man. The majority off civic technologies have to be interconnected individually and rely on the efforts of different roles (such as the political will of those in power, communications and mediations by the mediators and the execution by participating citizens) to promote the objectives and communicate the values; during the process, all parties must be willing for it to be possible for them to learn one another’s vocabulary and culture. Without an open-minded and powerful government holding the reins, it is nearly impossible to replicate the successful cases.

Civic technologies refer to the implementation of new technological tools to promote civic participation and thus increase communication, build consensus and use open data to improve the government’s transparency, parliament oversight and government accountability.

Unfortunately, civic technologies have yet to be systematically incorporated in the government’s operation and are difficult to build a comprehensive business model and ecosystem around them, preventing them from making full impacts.

Based on the above, we have listed the challenges facing open government in Taiwan below:

1. **The Open Government National Action Plan has not been fully incorporated. As a result, low-level government workers can only promote open government at a surface level or have troubles doing so.**  
     
   In the last two chapters, we have learned about the benefits of open-source and how many private businesses and civic initiatives utilized open technologies and values to improve their work culture and efficiency. However, we also must realize that open-source and openness may not have only positive impacts on the government’s governance. Listed below are some of the Taiwan government’s measures to promote digitalization and openness, the values that these measures satisfy and correspond to and the conflicts in practice:  
     
   Taiwan started its e-government program in 1998, with the focus mainly on administrative efficiency improvement but people started paying attention to the use of digital data. The Administrative Procedure Act was passed in 1999, providing initial regulation over open government data but only aiming to protect people’s rights.  
     
   The Freedom of Government Information Law was passed in 2005 as the first law that stipulates that the government should publish its information. Article 1 of the Act says “This Law is enacted to establish the institution for the publication of government information, facilitate people to share and fairly utilize government information, protect people's right to know, further people's understanding, trust and overseeing of public affairs, and encourage public participation in democracy.” It also clearly defines the information that the government should publish, including regulations, orders, interpretary orders, government agencies’ contact information, administrative guidance, administrative plans, budgets and audits, results of petitions, decisions of administrative appeals, documents related to public works and procurements, subsidies and meeting records of the agencies based on a collegiate system. Such information should be made available to the public actively with few exceptions. However, even though the Freedom of Government Information Law stipulates that the government should make its information available to the public “actively and timely”,  the act failed to define the term “timely” and does not specify the format or channels with which the government should publish its information. Therefore, this act is limited to the concept that the public has the right to know and is not practical when it comes to publication of information ([B. Chu & C. Tseng,2016](https://www.airitilibrary.com/Article/Detail/P20150327001-201612-201612300015-201612300015-54-66))  
     
   Based on the above, the protection of “the right to know” in the constitution is more in line with the core concept of open government data in Taiwan. Even though the Freedom of Government Information Law has principles similar to “openness”, it does not specify how the government should accept the concepts of equality, mutual-trust and collaboration that open source stands for, nor is the government likely to do so. These concepts, as flexible work logics, are nearly the opposite to the hierarchical state apparatus.  
2. **Open government is too difficult to participate and understand for the public or civic groups**  
   During our promotion of openness, we have realized that open government represents a major project for the Taiwanese people as it takes more than just explaining the concept. The public in general lacks a motivation or channel to participate in politics. As a result, when the open government concept emerged, the public did not have the passion to get involved in the decision-making process. Instead, they were watching on the sideline.  
     
   Even NGO partners do not assign high priority to open government as it covers a wide array of issues with more pressing issues at the frontline. They simply view “open government” as a concept that will be helpful if implemented but our life does not depend on it. In sum, open government is important but it takes a certain level of effort for the civic society to enjoy its values and implement its methodology. 

### Future Direction {#future-direction-2}

OCF has been actively promoting open government since 2016\. The foundation assembles a non-government delegation to attend the Open Government Partner Global Summit throughout the years. The foundation also published the first non-governmental [Taiwan Open Government Report](https://opengovreport.ocf.tw/report/#tab-0) in 2017\. With the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan deciding to adopt the OGP principles to formulate their own action plans in 2020, OCF was involved in the preparation and discussion of these action plans. Not only was OCF named a member of the first Open Government Committee, it also worked with the Executive Yuan to organize open government-related training and forums targeting the private sector, the general public and the international community. We will continue to promote open government and combine our initiatives with open technologies to promote open government data/information from both legal and international initiative perspectives. We will also increase the public’s knowledge and awareness about public-private partnership and open government.

In this regard, the foundation’s work can be categorised as below:

1. **Promote the promulgation of a special open data law and improve the data governance and application environment in Taiwan**

   On the foundation of the Freedom of Government Information Law and the promotion of a special open data law, continue to urge the government to fully implement open data/information in both quality and quantity.

2. **With the government promoting an open government action plan in compliance with the OGP principles, continue to encourage both the government and civic organizations to participate in open government affairs with the planning and execution of the commitments.**

* First attempt to get government agencies that are not highly involved in open government but in possession of a massive amount of data to participate in open government. By proposing propositions, building relationships and understanding these agencies’ pain points and needs, encourage them to open their data to implement public-private partnership.

* Attempt to reach the local level and build a successful public-private partnership on a smaller scale.

We also want to encourage the government to promote civic technology collaboration in the two directions below:

1. **Small government:** Do not consider yourself as the sole provider of public services. Instead, with comprehensive policies and solid infrastructure as the foundation, encourage the civic society and businesses to be involved in public services and thus build an ecosystem of civic technologies.  
     
2. **Open government:** The government, as one of the main stakeholders of public affairs, should open up its governance process and collaborate with the civic society equally to change this process, allowing the new open mechanism from the international community to mesh with the existing bureaucracy.

### FAQ {#faq-2}

#### **What is the Difference Between Sunshine Laws and Open Government?**

Both sunshine laws and open government are based on the people’s right to know and assume that open government data is the government’s obligation.

The implementation of sunshine laws in various countries focus on the prevention of abuse of power and corruption by public servants and representatives. Related laws include Political Donations Act, Act on Property-Declaration by Public Servants, Lobbying Act, Act on Recusal of Public Servants Due to Conflicts of Interest and Administrative Procedure Act. These laws all target a specific group of people respectively.

“Open government” mainly deals with open government data. With the emergence of international organizations such as Open Government Partnership, the implementation of the open government initiative will gradually gravitate towards public-private partnership and transparency with the emphasis on expanded participation.

Sunshine laws and open government can be considered different sides of the same foundation and principles, with their own results respectively.

#### **What is the difference between civic technologies and government technologies?**

Civic technologies and government technologies serve two different groups of people.

Civic technologies aim to provide information to the citizens, prompting them to communicate with and be involved with the government to work to improve the public interests together. Government technologies, on the other hand, aim to improve the efficiency inside the government and provide various tech support for the government.

Civic technologies empower the citizens while promoting social reform and helping the government see what the people need more clearly. Government technologies serve the government with the goal to improve its management efficiency.

Civic technologies and government technologies complement each other. Civic technologies help citizens to participate in the government’s decision-making process while government technologies help the government to respond to the citizens more effectively. By combining these two, more people will be involved with the government and the government can better respond to issues and formulate better decisions, which enhances the democratic evolution.

|  | Civic Tech | GovTech |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Target** | Citizens are the main beneficiary | The government itself |
| **Core** | Community | Operations |
| **Purpose** | Expand participation | Better efficiency |

#### **What is the core value of Open Government Partnership (OGP)?**

**Transparency**

Politics concern all people. During the process of policy formulation, the public should be made aware of what is going on. The public sector may worry that if people outside the government get a glimpse of the communication process of a pending bill, there may be some problems. However, the earlier the data is made available to the public, the easier it is for the public to understand the preparations that the public sector has made. With a narrowing gap in information, there is more opportunity to build mutual trust and even a partnership.

**Participation**

During the policy formulation process, give the general public a chance to join the discussions and express opinions over issues that they are interested in. The public can even influence the policy. Even though it will take the government longer to build consensus, there is less risk for a bill to be opposed by the public or even reversed once formulated.

**Accountability**

When the public has doubts about a policy’s formulation, they can trace the source of any given opinion and why it was/was not accepted. With an accountability mechanism, the goal is to cultivate a culture of accountability, holding each person accountable for their opinions.

**Inclusion**

Public affairs involve a wide array of facets. During the discussions of public affairs, the government should allow multiple stakeholders that will be directly impacted by a policy to fully express their opinions. By listening to and dialoguing with each other and collecting as many opinions from stakeholders as possible, the policy is less likely to go wrong.

# Chapter 4: From Concept to Reality – What Exactly is “Open”? {#chapter-4:-from-concept-to-reality-–-what-exactly-is-“open”?}

### Definition of “Open” {#definition-of-“open”}

According to Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF), “The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of “open” with respect to knowledge, promoting a robust commons in which anyone may participate, and interoperability is maximized.” Under this definition, knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

### Open Technologies to Social Participation {#open-technologies-to-social-participation}

The origin of “open” can be traced back to Karl Popper’s “The Open Society and Its Enemies” in 1945, in which he proposed the then-new concept of applying open philosophy to political science. The “open society” that Popper proposed was a brand-new social idea at the time. In this “open society”, a person’s identity, race or social class no longer matters as no one can ascertain the best path for the society at the very beginning. Therefore, open knowledge based on the collective information of all facilitates better decision-making. And thus, the discussion about knowledge sharing had begun. 

In this context, neoliberalism emerged in the US in the 1980s, contrast to the centralized social systems of the past (such as socialism, communism and fascism) where a small group of people is responsible for determining the most advantageous plan, which the public and scholars would question and reflect on. In light of this, economist/political philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek suggested that when a society reaches a certain level of complexity, freedom can only be ensured when ideas and implementation compete with each other and interact and adjust based on the changes under a decentralized structure. This discourse helped “openness”, a philosophical concept, to be incorporated in politics, the economy and even policies.

The hacker culture that originated from the 1960s prompted Richard Stallman to establish the Freedom Software Foundation, promote free software and eventually start the open source movement. As the acceptance towards “openness” becomes more common in politics, the economy and technological development, software and digital technological development has helped the concept of open knowledge to spread from coding to fields such as data and government management and brought forth more possibilities for implementation.

In 2003, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, in his book “Open Source Democracy: How Online Communication is Changing Offline Politics”, stated that the new digital renaissance has begun. He observed the tremendous impact the digital environment has on individual agency and pointed out that instead of purely and passively following the system, people now are capable of making changes, one example being the online voting platform; open source, a concept and process where multiple people are involved in the writing of a program, has indirectly prompted the discussion regarding how open the current system and social structure are ([Rushkoff,2003:56-57](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10753)). Tim O’Reilly, who is known for promoting modern technology knowledge and coining the term “Web 2.0”, proposed the concept “Government as a Platform.” He wrote:

 *“What if, instead of a vending machine, we thought of the government as the manager of a marketplace? In The Cathedral & the Bazaar, Eric Raymond uses the image of a bazaar to contrast the collaborative development model of open source software with traditional software development, but the analogy is equally applicable to government…A bazaar…is a place where the community itself ([2010:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYB8xokkWjg)).”*  
*exchanges goods and services.”*

O’Reilly’s “Government as a Platform” concept means that instead of being a service provider, the government will provide the basic framework of public services, such as data, infrastructure and regulations. Private companies, communities, individuals and other participants can, based on their needs and creativity, develop and provide all kinds of services freely. 

With digital technologies maturing, the trend of “openness” has gradually gone from open source, open data to open government, thanks to the digitalization of government services and the changes in the political/social environment. When former President Obama was inaugurated in 2008, he signed the [Memorandum](https://2009-2017.state.gov/open/index.htm) on Transparency and Open Government. As his first executive action, this directive aimed to improve government transparency and public  participation with digital technologies and open data, ushering in a new era of open and accountable government meant to bridge the gap between the American people and their government. This directive means that the concept of open government coupled with digital technologies has officially become a political system.

Overall, the open source movement in the software field from the 1980s emphasized on licensing your software development results for others to use, modify, distribute and reuse. If unsatisfied, anyone can fork a project into a new project to carry out their own ideas. In the modern society where private businesses are in control of the majority of platforms, open source technologies with users at their cores become an alternative if they would like to keep the freedom of determining their own digital civic rights. This indirectly fulfilled liberal political philosophers’ imagination for the implementation of openness in the public sphere, where the government is demanded to open up their data and policy-making process with the intention to increase the public’s participation in politics.

Quote from Tyng-Ruey Chuang (2022), according to their definition of “Openness”, it is not limited to just the interoperability between networks. It also applies to the freedom of users to access, modify and (re)distribute source codes, expressive works and datasets. It also proposes a participatory and interdependent mode of (co)production; sharing tangible and intangible resources; greater civic engagement and more accountability for those bearing the responsibilities; alternative governance models; socio-cultural movement against land enclosure and monopoly and an organizational paradigm characterized by dissolving boundaries or reducing barriers to facilitate innovation, amongst others. Openness is characterized by removing boundaries or obstacles to promote innovation ([T. Chuang, et al, 2022](https://policyreview.info/glossary/openness)).

### The Beauty and Sorrows of Openness {#the-beauty-and-sorrows-of-openness}

Thanks to the participation and sharing by multiple parties, open source code, data or knowledge can be used by all to reduce the possibility of repeating past mistakes and thus generate knowledge and solutions that are supported by more people even faster. “Openness” is a solution, but it also faces many challenges.

Regarding open source code, the contributors or communities are mostly those who contribute to the codes out of the sense of self-fulfilment and achievement without pay. With clear records of licensing and code contributions, open source communities always promote real contributions and will determine a member’s significance based on his/her contribution to the community. Therefore, even though open source is about public participation, without any obligations to contribute or a contractual relationship, only a small group of people actually contribute to the community and make the decisions for the community, contrasting to the ideal where all members’ wisdom will be utilized.

In addition, with open source code, the works of multiple creators can be preserved, allowing the community to have multiple contributors, which gives the community flexibility and creativity. However, the other side of the coin is that collaboration in the community is not obligatory. As the result, the community usually struggles to work in sync when facing an urgent or goal-oriented task.  
   
Regarding open data and open government, “openness” is not just a new way of work that does not follow all the rules, it also means that information/data storage, processing and use must be reconsidered and re-deployed in line with the latest development of digital technologies. A reform like open data/government is a significant impact to the bureaucracy where people at the bottom follow the example of the higher-ups. Therefore, if a bureaucracy wants to implement “openness”, the higher-ups need to have a clear vision and regulatory guidance. Otherwise, the civil society will not get to experience the transparency, collective participation and collaboration that “openness” emphasizes. 

### Conclusion: Why Does Society Need “Openness”? {#conclusion:-why-does-society-need-“openness”?}

Contrast to the centralized generation of knowledge and decision in the past, “openness”, as a revolutionary tactic, despite all the existing challenges, is still a path to trust, collaboration and sustainability with the development of digital technologies, which is the consensus of the democratic society worldwide.

Overall, “openness” can achieve the three objectives:

**Build Trust**

By opening up data, information or processes for the public to see and use, the information gap can be divided and trust can be built among different groups, which allows us to proceed to the next step – promote collaboration.

**Promote Collaboration**

Based on the trust built on information transparency, collaboration can be engaged on the foundation of people’s consensus after considering the pros and cons. This will ensure that all can participate, use and modify any open data. In other words, such collaboration has fluid (instead of fixed) standards, which prevents the monopoly of the formulation and development of policies, products and systems.

**Sustainable Development**

“Openness” is a way to make it possible to share knowledge. And the most important mechanism is where all can share their results in various systems, which promotes the sustainability of this production model where everyone can participate while depending on one another. Sharing is the final product of “openness” and all the results of “openness” are reflected in its products, from codes to government policies and even the society.

With the concept of “openness” and “open source”, everyone can contribute to a solution, which allows the society to be more autonomous with more native capabilities. The solutions formulated based on these concepts, even with limited licensing, can still be provided to anyone who wants to use, modify or build on these solutions. This will allow us to catch up with the latest and major technological breakthroughs and interact with the global community based on mutual trust and on an equal footing. Meanwhile, individuals and marginalized groups are also allowed to participate in the decision-making process, making public participation a reality ([Ito,, 2022](https://openfuture.eu/blog/open-source-is-unavoidable-open-source-policies-and-digital-sovereignty/)).

“Openness” is not a mindset derived only from the processing technologies utilized in the open source movement. As the government services become digitalized, “openness” is closely connected to the non-technological elements, helping citizens build citizen-centric services in an accountable governance framework, which will solidify the implementation of democracy.
